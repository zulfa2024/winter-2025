        <h1>Welcome to E-Pics for Change – Art That Makes a Difference</h1>
        <div class="text-box">
            <p>At E-Pics for Change, we believe in the power of visual storytelling and the strength of community. Our mission is simple: sell e-pictures (E-Pics)—stunning digital artwork and photography—and use every dollar of profit to support charitable efforts to fight homelessness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
            <p>Art has the power to inspire, connect, and transform lives. By purchasing our digital images, you’re not only gaining a beautiful piece of creativity—you’re also helping someone in need find food, shelter, and a fresh start.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
            <p>Unlike traditional businesses, every purchase you make directly supports charity. Our proceeds fund shelters, meal programs, and job assistance initiatives for people experiencing homelessness.</p>
