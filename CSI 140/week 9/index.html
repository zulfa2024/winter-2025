            Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be,
            And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.

        <div class="orange-section">
            
            Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

            Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.
